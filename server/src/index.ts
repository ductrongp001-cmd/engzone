Used to confirm information or ask for agreement.

Structure:
• Positive statement → negative tag
  - You are tired, aren't you?
  - She works here, doesn't she?
  - They have finished, haven't they?

• Negative statement → positive tag
  - He isn't late, is he?
  - You don't like coffee, do you?
  - She hasn't arrived yet, has she?

Special cases:
• I am → aren't I? (I'm right, aren't I?)
• Let's → shall we? (Let's go, shall we?)
• Imperative → will/won't you? (Open the door, will you?)
• There is → isn't there? (There is a problem, isn't there?)

Intonation:
• Rising tone → asking for confirmation (unsure)
• Falling tone → expecting agreement (sure)`,

      title: "Direct & Indirect Objects",

Direct Object (DO): receives the action directly
• I bought a book. (What did I buy? → a book)
• She wrote a letter. (What did she write? → a letter)

Indirect Object (IO): receives the direct object
• I bought him a book. (For whom? → him)
• She wrote me a letter. (To whom? → me)

Word order patterns:
1. Verb + IO + DO (no preposition)
   • He gave his mother a present.
   • She sent her friend a postcard.

2. Verb + DO + to/for + IO
   • He gave a present to his mother.
   • She sent a postcard to her friend.

Common verbs with two objects:
• give, send, show, tell, offer, teach, lend, sell
• buy, make, get, cook, find, keep + for
• explain, describe, suggest + to (NOT: explain me → explain to me)

Pronoun order:
• When both objects are pronouns: V + DO + to/for + IO
  - I gave it to her. (NOT: I gave her it)`,

      title: "Word Order in English Sentences",

Basic structure:
Subject + Verb + Object + Manner + Place + Time
• I + met + my friend + unexpectedly + at the mall + yesterday.
• She + drives + her car + carefully + on the highway + every morning.

Adverb placement:
1. Before the main verb (for frequency adverbs)
   • I always wake up early.
   • She never eats meat.
   • They usually take the bus.

2. After 'be' verbs
   • He is always late.
   • They are never on time.

3. Between auxiliary and main verb
   • I have never been to Japan.
   • She will always love him.

Order of adjectives (before a noun):
Opinion → Size → Age → Shape → Color → Origin → Material → Purpose
• a beautiful (opinion) big (size) old (age) round (shape) brown (color) Italian (origin) leather (material) handbag
• a lovely small new wooden table

Inversion in questions:
• Yes/No: Auxiliary + Subject + V? (Do you like it?)
• Wh-: Wh-word + Aux + S + V? (Where do you live?)

Direct vs Indirect questions:
• Direct: Where is the station?
• Indirect: Could you tell me where the station is? (no inversion)`,
